        <h3 class="NPCAYLC">National Park Conservation Association North East Young Leader  </h3>
    
        <p>A New Jersey Native, Grace grew up just outside the Sandy Hook unit of Gateway National Recreation Area,
            which cultivated a lifelong passion for the diverse stories told through history and the environment.</p>
         <p>  This passion drives Grace's commitment to sharing overlooked and untold histories.
            She served as a researcher on female lighthouse keepers of the New York Harbor Region for exhibition 
            at Twin Lights Historic Site, where she currently works. 
             
            Grace has also contributed to a collaborative report on interpretive themes at Stonewall National Monument
            with the National Park Conservation Association (NPCA).  In 2024, 
            she joined the NPCA North East's inaugural Young Leaders Council. </p>   
            
            
        <p> Grace holds a degree in Biological Anthropology from Arizona State University. She is currently pursuing a 
            Master's in Library and Information Science from Pratt Institute. </p>
