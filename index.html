<p class="welcome">
            The <strong>National Park Service</strong> oversees and manages a huge system of parks and historic sites, but due to 
           chronic underinvestment in necessary maintenance and repairs over the years has led to a staggering <strong>$23.3 billion backlog of deferred maintenance.</strong>
            The longer these issues are left unaddressed, the more expensive the repairs become. <br> </p>
<p>Deferred maintenance directly impacts a visitor's time within the National Parks. The parks are meant to inspire wonder, but when visitors are met with trails they can't hike down and buildings they can't enter, inspiration turns into frustration. This leaves visitors with a diminished experience, unable to enjoy the parks as they were meant to be.</p>
            
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="shapesandsizes">
            <strong>Deferred maintenance comes in all shapes and sizes, including </strong> </p>
        <ul class="list1">
    <li> <strong> Closed visitor centers </strong>
       <ul> 
           <li> Less opportunities to talk with rangers</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li> <strong>Overgrown trails  </strong>
        <ul>
        <li> Can be dangerous for both new and experienced hikers</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li> <strong> Inaccessible infrastructure</strong>
        <ul>
        <li> Closed roads, bridges, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
   <li> <strong> Overburdened Bathrooms </strong>
        <ul>
        <li> Where's the toilet paper?</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ul>  
        
  <br>
        
 <p class="welcome3"> <strong>The Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA)</strong> helped combat deferred maintenance head on.
            Introduced in 2019, GAOA provided a total of 6.65 billion dollars to address repairs in parks across the
            country. </p>
<p class="bottomtext1">  <strong>The law that brought GAOA into existence will expire in 2025. But you have the power to make meaningful change. Explore this website to learn how you can take action. </strong> </p>
